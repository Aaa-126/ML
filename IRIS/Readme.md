This is a basic classification project Using iris dataset.
This is to explore several utilitiies and how the good data peering 
helps in building a model that is effiecient and simple.

The iris dataset used is standard one and if you look carefully at the 
plots you can clearly see that if data is linearly separated would provide a 
good result.
